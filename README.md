# Ethan's Prework Project

## Description

This is a web page built with some introductory development techniques. Building this page allowed me to get acquainted with a few languages, as well as familiarize myself with github and my machine's command line. It serves as a reference point for notes and useful tips I pick up as I continue to learn.
